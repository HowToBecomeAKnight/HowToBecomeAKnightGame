The game has some bugs in VR mode. Currently, the menu does not work in the VR version but works fine
in the non-VR version of the game. 

Please refer to the mp4 video "willyCutScene" before playing the game. We were unable to include into
the game because we lacked Unity Pro.

There was some lighting issues that might crop up for some of the levels (they might appear REALLY dark).
If this is a real issue try running the scene separatly.
